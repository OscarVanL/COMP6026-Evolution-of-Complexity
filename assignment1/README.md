# Assignment 1 Answers

Three techniques were explored for solving the "monkeys using typewriters" problem, where random variation will eventually match the string "methinks it is like a weasel". 

A basic mutation hill climber, a genetic algorithm without crossover, and a genetic algorithm with crossover.

Although there is some random variation, below are the number of fitness evaluations required:

1. Mutation hill climber: 4397500 evaluations

2. Genetic Algorithm without Crossover: 59936 evaluations

3. Genetic Algorithm with Crossover: 8934 evaluations.
